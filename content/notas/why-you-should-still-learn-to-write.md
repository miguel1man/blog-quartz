In 1997, a computer called Deep Blue amazed the world by defeating the world chess champion, Garry Kasparov. This was a significant achievement for artificial intelligence, showing that machines could now compete with humans even in complex tasks like chess.

After that defeat, many predicted that people would stop playing chess, since there would be no point in competing against a machine that always wins. However, the opposite has happened, chess is more popular today than ever before.
Artificial players

So why is this? Why do people still enjoy playing chess despite machines being able to beat them? I believe it's because chess is more than just a game. It's a way to challenge ourselves, learn, and to grow. It's a means of connecting with others and sharing our love for the game.

Machines can never replicate the satisfaction of outsmarting an opponent or the joy of playing a game with a friend. While machines may improve in chess, they can never replace the human spirit that makes the game so special.

That's why humanity will never stop playing chess, even if artificial players can now defeat them.
Artificial writers

I believe this applies to writing as well. Machines can outperform humans in certain cases, such as generating grammatically correct and factually accurate text. That's why I'm using an artificial writer to help me communicate with you in English, my second language.

While machines may improve in various aspects, it's unlikely that they will ever completely replace humans. We will always have the desire to connect, learn, and challenge ourselves. That's why we will always want to become better writers.

After all, writing is more than giving information, it is about expressing ourselves, sharing our thoughts and feelings, and connecting with readers. These are aspects that machines can never match as well as humans. Yet.
Artificial coders

I was fascinated by ChatGPT, the most famous AI in the world, because it could answer your questions in text, but not with images. So I decided to create a ChatGPT clone that could respond to your questions with funny gifs.

I worked on my app for weeks, and finally, it was finished. I had created a ChatGPT clone that could respond using funny gifs. It used the Giphy API to get the funny gifs. I was so proud of myself. I had created something new and innovative.

As I reflected on my achievement, I couldn't help but wonder: If a self-taught developer like me can build this app for free, what bigger apps are developing the big tech companies? That's when it hit me: we are still in the early stages of AI development. Even the app of a junior developer can shine with the help of artificial coders.

AI is changing the way we write and code. It is making it easier, faster, and more creative. With AI, we can create anything we can imagine. Let's embrace this new technology and use it to create amazing things!
