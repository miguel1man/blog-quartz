title: "The basic function of a Master"
---

> The basic function of a Master is not to serve as a model of rational reasoning, providing the ultimate arguments for adopting a certain position, but, on the contrary, to surprise us by uttering statements which run against our (and the Master’s own) hitherto doxa; that is, by performing gestures which cannot but appear as willful arbitrariness.
