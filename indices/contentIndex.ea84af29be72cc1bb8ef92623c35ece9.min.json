Porque 24 horas antes que comience el evento yo no conoc√≠a a Ela, Gustavo, Jorge y Livia. ¬°A√∫n as√≠ ganamos el primer lugar en el reto de BNB y un premio de $1000!\n\nPero, ¬øC√≥mo es posible que un grupo de desconocidos hayan construido una app y una amistad en tan poco tiempo? Yo culpo a la blockchain. Esta m√°gica tecnolog√≠a atrae a las buenas personas. (Aunque tambi√©n atrae especuladores)\n\nEn los primeros 2 d√≠as del evento tuvimos muchas ideas, pero al comentarlas con los mentores, todos nos indicaban los puntos d√©biles de nuestro proyecto. No nos rendimos. Seguimos iterando. Seguimos so√±ando y lo conseguimos. Primer lugar. Hasta ahora no lo creo.\n\n## Gracias a LATAM WEBX HACKATHON hice m√°s networking en una semana que en todo a√±o...\n\nEl primer d√≠a no conoc√≠a a nadie pero logr√© unirme a un grupo.\n\nEl segundo d√≠a conoc√≠ un equipo conformado por un contador, un emprendedor y una f√≠sico nuclear. Ten√≠an ideas pero les faltaba un desarrollador. As√≠ que fui caminando en busca de uno (o sea buscando alguien que pareciera a mi). Lo encontr√©, me present√© y le pregunt√© ¬øEst√°s buscando grupo para la hackathon? Dijo que s√≠ y lo llev√© con ellos. Freddy no se uni√≥ a ese equipo. Pero encontr√≥ otro grupo y ganaron el tercer lugar.\n\nAs√≠ que no importa si eres programador, dise√±ador o emprendedor. Todos y todas pueden participar en un hackathon. Se los recomiendo. Es un evento que te puede cambiar la vida. Y si ya asististe a una, invita a tus amigos o colegas.\n\n## ¬øCu√°l fue nuestra idea ganadora para la hackathon de Andino DAO?\n\nMillones de peruanos ya utilizan \"monedas imaginarias\" para comprar productos reales. Se llaman puntos bonus o millas para viajes. Entonces ¬øC√≥mo logramos que las empresas y sus clientes utilicen \"tokens\" como puntos de fidelidad?\n\nFIDELIZAME es una aplicaci√≥n descentralizada que propone una soluci√≥n a este problema. Estamos buscando partners que nos ayuden a que miles de usuarios interact√∫en con su primera wallet.\n","lastmodified":"2023-06-04T16:07:49.886745323Z","tags":["hackathon","networking"]},"/notas/proof-of-email":{"title":"Proof of Email - The easiest way to onboard to blockchain","content":"\nHave you ever wondered what it would be like to have your own blockchain address without the hassle of complicated phrases and secret words? Imagine having a wallet that is uniquely linked to your email, allowing you to interact with the world of blockchain effortlessly. That's the concept behind \"Proof of Email.\"\n\nOpening a blockchain wallet and diving into the world of cryptocurrency can be overwhelming for many. It often requires technical knowledge and a deep understanding of complex concepts. But with Proof of Email, you don't need to be a tech expert. We're about to make blockchain onboarding as easy as sending an email.\n\n## Secure \u0026 Unique\n\nSo, how does it work? It all revolves around the power of SHA-256, a clever cryptographic function that can convert any text into a unique sequence of characters. We'll take the text of your email, run it through SHA-256, and voila! You now have an Ethereum private key.\n\nBut you might be thinking, \"Isn't my email address public?\" Well, you're absolutely right! That's why we have an added layer of security. We can include a secret phrase with your email and generate the private key. This way, only you and our app will know the private key, keeping it safe from prying eyes.\n\nOnce you have your private key, you can import it into a wallet of your choice. Just like that, you'll have a blockchain address associated with your email. No more struggling with complicated phrases or worrying about where you wrote them down. With Proof of Email, it's as simple as checking your inbox.\n\n## Guaranteed Ownership\n\nNow, you might be wondering, what's the catch? Well, this type of wallet isn't designed for accumulating cryptocurrency. Instead, it's perfect for collecting soulbound tokens or obtaining tokens that cannot be sold or traded. Think of it as a special wallet dedicated to showcasing your unique collection or accessing exclusive content. Rest assured, nobody can steal your Soulbound Tokens.\n\nImagine the joy of collecting Soulbound NFTs or tokens that grant you special privileges within a specific ecosystem. With Proof of Email, you can participate in blockchain projects that require an email-associated wallet, without the complexities of traditional wallets.\n\nThe potential uses for this type of wallet are enormous. It opens up new opportunities for engagement, interaction, and ownership within the blockchain space. So, even though this wallet may not hold traditional cryptocurrency, it paves the way for exciting new possibilities.\n\n## Simple Onboarding\n\nProof of Email is a game-changer when it comes to introducing people to the world of blockchain. It simplifies the process, making it accessible to anyone with an email address. No more confusion, no more technical jargon‚Äîjust a seamless way to connect your digital identity with the blockchain.\n\nRemember, sometimes the simplest solutions can lead to the most extraordinary experiences. So, why wait? Take the first step and try Proof of Email today. You can search for \"SHA256 generator\" on Google or ask an AI about it.\n","lastmodified":"2023-06-04T16:07:49.890745388Z","tags":["blockchain","onboarding"]},"/notas/why-you-should-still-learn-to-write":{"title":"Why you should still learn to write (even if an AI can do it better)","content":"\n![Robot escribiendo](/notas/imagenes/why-you-should-still-learn-to-write.jpeg)\n\nIn 1997, a computer called Deep Blue amazed the world by defeating the world chess champion, Garry Kasparov. This was a significant achievement for artificial intelligence, showing that machines could now compete with humans even in complex tasks like chess.\n\nAfter that defeat, many predicted that people would stop playing chess, since there would be no point in competing against a machine that always wins. However, the opposite has happened, chess is more popular today than ever before.\n\n## Artificial players\n\nSo why is this? Why do people still enjoy playing chess despite machines being able to beat them? I believe it's because chess is more than just a game. It's a way to challenge ourselves, learn, and to grow. It's a means of connecting with others and sharing our love for the game.\n\nMachines can never replicate the satisfaction of outsmarting an opponent or the joy of playing a game with a friend. While machines may improve in chess, they can never replace the human spirit that makes the game so special.\n\nThat's why humanity will never stop playing chess, even if artificial players can now defeat them.\n\n## Artificial writers\n\nI believe this applies to writing as well. Machines can outperform humans in certain cases, such as generating grammatically correct and factually accurate text. That's why I'm using an artificial writer to help me communicate with you in English, my second language.\n\nWhile machines may improve in various aspects, it's unlikely that they will ever completely replace humans. We will always have the desire to connect, learn, and challenge ourselves. That's why we will always want to become better writers.\n\nAfter all, writing is more than giving information, it is about expressing ourselves, sharing our thoughts and feelings, and connecting with readers. These are aspects that machines can never match as well as humans. Yet.\n\n## Artificial coders\n\nI was fascinated by ChatGPT, the most famous AI in the world, because it could answer your questions in text, but not with images. So I decided to create a ChatGPT clone that could respond to your questions with funny gifs.\n\nI worked on my app for weeks, and finally, it was finished. I had created a ChatGPT clone that could respond using funny gifs. It used the Giphy API to get the funny gifs. I was so proud of myself. I had created something new and innovative.\n\nAs I reflected on my achievement, I couldn't help but wonder: If a self-taught developer like me can build this app for free, what bigger apps are developing the big tech companies? That's when it hit me: we are still in the early stages of AI development. Even the app of a junior developer can shine with the help of artificial coders.\n\nAI is changing the way we write and code. It is making it easier, faster, and more creative. With AI, we can create anything we can imagine. Let's embrace this new technology and use it to create amazing things!\n","lastmodified":"2023-06-04T16:07:49.890745388Z","tags":["writing","ai"]}}
